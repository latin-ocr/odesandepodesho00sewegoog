oon xx1v.] ODES OF HORACE. 111

Whose wains 'm oourse their homes nomadio dravo,
And haniy Gotio tribes,

For whom unmetod aoros unenolosed
Fruitoge and Ceres beas.

Nor ploosos them a tilth beyond the year ;
And him who haoh disohorgod

His toilsomo books, a suooessor roliovoo
with lotto1y importial

There sor hor soopsons, of a mother rost,
Tho wife doth mix their oups

Thoughtloss of harm: nor doth the dower’d wife
Rulo 0’er hor man, nor trust

In some sloek pommour. The wealthiost dower
Of parents virtue is,

And chootity, that bound by compaot fix’d
Dmods any seoond man ;

And sinis an unuttorable deod,
Or death instead a pn'ze.

Ο whosoo'er shall wish to sweep away
Our godless maosaores and rago

Intestino, if as Father of our citios
He yeam oo see his namo

Inscribod ’neoth statues, let him dare to ourb
Our wild licontiousnoss3

He glorious unto agos aster-bom ;
Sinoe (ποθ bo us ‘ohe orime 1)

Virtue unsoathed we loothe ; but onoo upborne
Ouo of our sight we sook it,

We souls of onvy. What avm'l oomplaints
Of sorrow, ifthe fault

Is not out off by vengmnoe? What our lawa,
All futile without mannerss

If nor the quartor of tho globo closed in
By glowing sultry honos,
