ΡΗσιιΒσε, and thou the forest queen,
Dian, bright glory of tho uphem,
Pow'rs aye 01010110 and 0110101,

That virgin maida„ a chosen 11010,
And sinless boys, to Powers of Hem,
Whose joy the seven hius have been,
A hymn should raise.

Boon Sol, who op’st and shroud’st the day
In radiant oar, and spring'st from gloom
still different and the same, mayst thou
