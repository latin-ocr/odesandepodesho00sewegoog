ODE XXV.

To BAOOHUS.

Α nmmum.

Quo me, Baoehe.

Wmt, Ο Bacchus, where art thou teusing me
Fun of thyselss O, into what bovwrs,

Or into what deep caves are they bearing me
Fleet, with a spirit of new-born poweffl

In what dark gmts will they list my story,
While I muso to enrol above
Peerless Oaesar’s undying glory,

Mid starsandthe synodhall ofJovev

A theme ΠΙ ehanss me of glory‚ new,
Yet unutter’d by others’ lips,

E'en thus Bacchus, with sleepless view,
sits entranoed on the mountojn-steeps 3

Gazing forth on Hebrus and Thrace
Snow-glazed over, and Rhodope,

Trodden with foot of a savage moe.
How, as with wayward step I stray

At fiver banks and at lonely elmles,
”fis swoet to marvel Ξ 0 sov’reign thou
Of Naiad ehoirs, and Baechio maids
Stmng the tan ash with their hands to bow:

Nothing mean or in lowly main,
Nought that can ever die will 1 sing 3
Sweet is the peril to join the min
of tho God (Ο thou the Lonoean king),
Gimling my brows with his vine-leaf green.
