Ο Gonnus& who dost hold thy sway
O’er Antium lovod-thou ever nigh,
ffither from lowest wale of ποθ
Ourmortalfiametolistonhigh,
Or traina triumphnl proud and stem
Into funerea] pompe to tum

Theo in his penury <loth coum
And oenvass with a fretful prayer,
The tiller of his semland 3-thee,
As sov'reign of the main, whoe'er
Is lashing the carpathian sea
With a Bithynian argosy‚

Theo Dania's son of savage mod„
Thoe the on-flitting Tartar hordas,
And towns, and tn'bes, and latium fieroe,
And mothers of barbarian lonis,

And pusplo tyrmts dread, lest thou,
With foot of wauton mischiess low

Spurn down the tow'ring ΒΜ 3 or lest
The populace, with thronging ruah,

Το arms the flagging soulg to arms
Alarum, and the empire crush

Ever in the van of thee

Walketh thy serf Necessity,
