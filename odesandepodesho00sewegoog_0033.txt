From Dion, ond, with stop unsoon,

Eludod, ond the wotohfiro posto

Of Thessoys ond comped hosts-

Ruthloos onomios to osny.

Dost holy spirits loy to rosh 3

And, with goldon rod, arroso

Tho phantom throng—tho favourito thou

To ol] of gods, both them obovo and them below.

Tu no ommim.

Tum not to ool< (itis o orimo to know)

What end to me, what unto thee tho gods,
Leuconoe, hove assigno 3 nor moyst thou tempo
Assyriam calculatione. How for better,
Whobevor shall betide theo, to onduro ς ’
Who'oher moro winton, or ohio one thy last
Jove doth bestow, which 'gainot its borrier rooko
Is now exhausting the Tyrrhenion ooo.

Wioo bo thou-clear thy winoo—ood to o spon
of nmow bound pruno book too lengthen’d hope ;
E'en while wo talk, will enviouo h'fe have flod.
Sootoh thou the prosont hour 3 little ao moy
Too fondly trusting to tho morrow's light.
