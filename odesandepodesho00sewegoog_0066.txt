ODES OF HORACE.

(E’en ae e hawk the sssken doves,

Or, ee in enow-cled Haemon'u plaine
A hunter swift the here pursues)‚

That he might soon eonsign to chains
The moneeer sight of destiny:
Her who seerehing how te die

A death more like her lineage, neither
semled end eower'd the steel before
Like woman ,-n0r with feer- -πίῃς’(1 ίίοθί

, Made for some distent skulking shore,
But brook'd with eye serene to face

Her pale-ce, grov’lling m diegmee—

She, hero-eoul','d een forked eeps
To stroke, that through her frame entire,

Black venom she might swellow-she,
When death hed ponder'd been, with 1re

More seve-ge stffl, as grudging ποίῃ
To thy Idbmniens void of ruth,

As one unqueen’d‚ in tn'umph proud
Slow to be tmil'd along the crowd,
She-women of no vulger blood.
