ODES ΟΡ HOMCE.

Another may a thmng more great
Of client followors claim

With law impattial iron fate
In lottory doth win
Blnon'd and meanest men 3
One roomy vase shakes every mma

For him whose godiooe neck of elimo
The sword unsheath'd hange o'er,

No flavour met will there sublime
The sensis of sicil„
No choml minstrelsy

Os birds and lyre will sleep restore.

Sleep, gentle sleep, with no disdain

Is looking on the roos
Low nesiling of the rural swain,

Or bank embower'd in shadai

Nor Tempe's breezojfann'd glades„
The soul that only yon-neth for enough

Neither the boisterous sea with dread
Prote, nor the mad mult

Of setting Bear, or rising Kid ς
Not vineyard by the stom
Of haiistones soourged, οι· farm

Deoeitfifl, while ihe ime doth hold at fault,

One hour the mins from heaven, one hour
The stam that soorch the leas ;

The winters now thui hmhly lower.
As many a monster heap
Is plunged into the deep,

The finny tribes pereeive the narrow’d sena
