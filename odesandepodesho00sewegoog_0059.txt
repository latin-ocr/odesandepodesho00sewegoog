Powimur.

Smozz'n are νος if that ought,
’Neath the shade in vacant thought,

We have trifled erst with theo-
Aught that may ¹have life to see
Both this year and mom-away 1
Raise my lyre a Latian lay!

Thou who first didst tune thy strain
For a Iaesbian denizen ,·

who in war of lion soul

still amidst the battle's lull,

0111 he on the oozy strand

Had moor’d his stom-toss’d bark to land,
Of Bacchus and the Muses' band,
And Venus and her boy was singing
Ever to her fondly clinging,

And of Lycus passing fair,

With jetsblack eyes and jet-black 111111.
0 Apollo’s pn‘de, and guest

At the banquets glad-catess'd

01 impen'al J ove-O, shell

Sonow’s ποθὴ and soothing spelL
Unto me, with due appeal

Galling, teem with blessings still}
