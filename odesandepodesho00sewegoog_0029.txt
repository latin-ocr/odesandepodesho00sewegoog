ODE VI. -
χ vo nemeen
Scriberis Venio.
Smin eheie thou be by Varius as the breve,
And vietor 0’er thy sees—Verius, a sven

of etrain Maeonien, whetsoe'er exploit Ι
Thy fiennesoul’d soldiery on ships or eteeds

Hath vvrought, with thee to lead them: We, Agnppe,
Neithev these themes to eelebrete eeeay,

Nor the destructive ire of i'elens’ son

Who knew not how to yield ; nor the career

Of the gane-mask’d Ulysses 0'er the sea3

Nor Pelops'nuthless house-we humble bande,
Themes of such ginndeur5 while the bnshful soni,
And Muse, the queen of the unwarlike lyve,
Forbids ue to deteriorate the laude

Of glon‘ous Oaeear, and thine own, by fault

of our own native wie. who in fit strain

Of Mam in adementine tunic cled

Oould duly write, or Merion, blank with duee

Of Troy, or Tydeus' eon, by Pellas’ aid,

Mateh for the gods above? We do bue chent
Of feneis convivial ; vve of maidens' were,

With closepered mile fgeinst youthfin vooers fieree,
We with henrts disengaged 3 er if ab nll

We buin, nghe trifling not beyond our vvont. '
