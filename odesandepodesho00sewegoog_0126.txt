At what price we may purchase a Ohien cask,
Who may the wehers with fixes ahlay,

Who lending house-roem, end when, Ι may ’scepe
These Pehgnian hoste, you nothing say.

Fill ιο the new moon-quieh, boy, fill
To midnight 3 fill ιο our augur friend,

Murena, with ghsses three or nine,
suited ιο eaeh leh the goblees blend,

Fer thfiee three glesses distraught will cell,
A minstrel he 3 but more than three
The power that dreedeth rioh and brawl,

She, h'nk'd in hand with the unveil’d sistere,
Graee, forbids us to touch To play

The maniae is luxury. Why do blasts
of Berecynth's pipe their stoeehn delayh

Why hange ’ohe flute with the silent lyreh

He who loves the uneven Nino

Grudging hands I am loething. Seather Ἰ
Blossems of rosee Fun os envy

Let Lycus list ιο the frenzied clatter,

And our seir neighbour, little suited
To the old Lycus„ Thoe, with heir
Thick οΙιιιιιοιἨ, glossy, Telephus, thee
Like ιο the mystel evening stae,
Blooming Rhode is wooing. Me,
Bums the slew fleme of my Glycere.
