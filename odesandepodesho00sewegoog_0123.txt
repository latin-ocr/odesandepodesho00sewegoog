σοι xvr] ODES OF HORACE.

For noughh end joy the side to fly
Of rich men, a desertor 1-
Ι with a lustro fer more great,
’ The lord of a despised estate,
Than ffi whnte’er the sturdy-bred
Apulien ploughs, myself were said
within my granges close to shore,
¹. Amidst enormous debes poor.
. A fill of water clear as dew,
And woodland of but aeres few,
' And the sure promise seiling not
Of my own harvest, in ies lot
More blessed fer, deth cheat away
The palm from him who glitters gay
Ι In fertile Affle’s regal sway.
Though ner Calabriae bees produee
Me honeyn, nor the Beeehie juiee
In Laestrygoninn hognheeds wanes
Το sostnees for me, nor in plnres
Of Gallio pastures multiply
Rich wools ; yet troublous poverby
Stantis far aloofl Nor, should I ehoose
Aughe more, wouldst thou eo give refuse
Better my nnrrow revenues
May 1 extend, by drawing close
Desire, then if I pieeed in one
With pleins which the Mygdoniam own
The reelm of Halyattea Such
As ask for much there ferleth much.
'ris well with hjm to whom kind Heaven
With hugal hand enough heth given.
