ODES OF HORACE.

In the poor's chamolt to disperse

The ashes nine days from the heurse.
Thjne is a bremt for welcomo mild,

And spotleus hands ; und thy womb's child
Is Pactumeius ; und with rud gore

Of thine the midwifu butheth o'or

Her ruge, whenever us a etout

Patturient thou 'are sallyiug out.

cumu’s Auswuu

Why pour to olomeu’d ears thy prayerst
Not to the nuked marineus

More deas its rocks with the deep surge
Does the wild wiut1y Neptune soourge.
Thut thou unpuniah’d should have mouk'd
Ootytto’s mysteries, unlook'd

To eyes profane-that rite divine

Of Oupid, the young libertine!

And ulaiming the aruhpriost to bo

Of Esquiliniun sorouy,

Should, without penalty or alume,

Have fill’d the city with my nume Ι
what wus the use that I with rietes
Heap’d those Peligniun old witcheu

· Or brew'd u poisonous potatiou

Quicker than al] in operation 2
But as for thee, u doom too slow
For thy petitiuns bidos thee now 5
And joyless must u lise by thee
Be dmined out in misory 3

For this, that you may still supply
Food for new pangs of ugony.
