Ι, a bird of sweetest musi&
Mo shall colchia’s host, and ho

who now striveth to dissemble
His terror of the Mmian eohort,
And remotest Gelons know.

And the quaffer of the Rhone-stream
Hence with dirges from my bustal,
Where I am not, and lamentings
Full of infamy, and wuilings ;
Hush your outcry, and abandon
All the superfluous homage of a tomb.
