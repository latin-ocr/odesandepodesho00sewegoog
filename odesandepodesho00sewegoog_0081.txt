With ifflry lyre and heir-bound back,
Into a eleek end lmotted braid,

In ieshion of a Spartan maid.

ODE XII.
ro menne.

Nolis heyaseroe bella Numwntioe.

Wrsn noi that fieree Numantie's long-drawn were,
N or the siem Hannibal, nor Sieel eea
ι Orimson’d with Punie blood, should wedded be
Unio ihe herp’s eost strains :
N or maddening Lapithae, and him too grose
In wine, Hylaeus, or the youihfirl brood
of Tellus by Herculean arm subdued ;
¹ Whenee et the peril ehook,
E'en to ite base, old Saturn's gliiiering dome 3
And thou, in chronielee of prose eher tell
Of Oeesar’s many a battle far more well,
Maecenas, end of neoke
Of threniening monarche, through the public ways
Led on in triumph Me the muse so dear
Rath will’d the minstrelsies io chent of her,
The mistress of my heare,
Lyeimnia 3 me her liquid sperkling eyes,
And bosom true io our right-mutual love-
Her whom ie neither has misseem'd to more
Her fooistep in ihe dence,
Nor to compete in frolic, nor to offer
Her arms 'te ihe embraee, when she doeh play
With 'ohe gay virgins on the fesiei day
Of voi’ry-follow’d Dian.
