ODES OF Home. 149

Not they in Danube deep who sleke
Their thiat, the J ulian lewe shall break ,·
Not Gom, not the Serio hordes,
Or Persiens faithless te their words,
Not they by Tanm’ fiood-s‘eream born.
And we elike on every mom,
common and hellow'd, while we share ’
The boens of frolie Bacchus, there
With our young rane and matrone true,
First having preyed in order due ’
Το heaven, in n'te from sires descende&
The hymn with pipes of Lydia blended‚
chiefs who aJl virtue did fulfil,
And Ilion end Anchises still,

And boon Dione’s rece in minstreIsy wiJl trffl.
