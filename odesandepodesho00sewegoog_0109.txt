ODE VI.

το m noma
Debicta mojwmn &mmmm ἄασε.
Tm? father's crimes, Ο child of Rome,
Thyself nought mefiting their doom,
Shalt thou atone for, till each shrine
And ’nottering sane of Powers divine,

And imaged forms thou hant replaced,
With smoky blswlmess now defaced.

Vail’d to the gods because thou bearest

Thy head, the impezial orown thou wearest ‚
Rom this each origin of gfflce,

Το this each issue back retraoe.

The gods when scorn’d have many a blow

Dealt on Hesperia’s land of woe.

Twioo now Monoeses and the band
of Pacorus each onslaught, plann'd

By us with auspices unbless'd‚
Have crush’d, and 11st their glisstering erest,

At having added plunder'd gains
Unto their petty wreathed chains

It wanted little, that the walls
of‘ Rome, possess'd by faotione bmen,
Daoian and Ethiopia's son
Razed out ; with his amado one

· A foeman dread, the other far.¹
Mightier‚ with volley'd shafts [in war}
