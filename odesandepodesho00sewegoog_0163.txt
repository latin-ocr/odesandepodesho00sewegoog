ODE XII.
no v1ne1n
J osm vorle comitae.
Now the Spring'e pursuivente, which enethe the see,
Thmeie’s light eim, the threeden selle ere lenning ,·

Ner neither meede ere sterk, nor rivers grewl,
Swoll'n with a winter’s snow.

Her nest she fines, Itys eedly waning,
Thae haplees bird, end the undying eheme
Of Cecrop’e hell, became she ill avenged

The eevege lueis of kinge.

Streteh'd on the lenden bethago, to the flute
The sleek-fed lembe' protectore hymns ere einging;
And ehem the Deiey, whom floeke delight,

And Areedie'e denk hille

Thnse heve the eeeeone brought to us, my Virgil 3
But if thou lein wouldet queff of Beeehue preee’d
Ae Oelee, thou of noble youths the client,

Wine ehelt thou win with nenl

One little nendehell will e eesk elicit,
Which in the stores Sulpiciam now reposee,

Bounteoue eo give new hopes, end effieeeione
Oenes’ gell to waeh ewey.

Unio which jeys if thou ert hasting, ewistly

Come with thy bargain: little em Ι mueing

With oups of mine all gillleee to imbue thee,
Ae rich in e full hell.
