ODES OF uoulou. [noox ιν.

Light to thy oountry, ohieltoiu blest, restore ;
For, like tho spriugtido, when thy sooe hae shone

Upou thy people‚ heppier posses on
The day, ond euno with iuirer beauty emile.

E'en os o youth, whom his return deluyiug
More then a year-long course, beyond the plains ,
Of tho Gaqsothilm sea Notus dotatus

Withenviousbust,farfromhisoherish’dh0me‚ l

On him with vows‚ ond omem, ond with prayers
His mother calls, nor from tho windiug strand

Her grue withdraweth: so our sotherlaud,
Smitten with loyal yeominge seolm for Oaesur.

For soie from herm the heifer roves the fielde

Ceres and fosteiing bounty feeds our leus 3'
Tho murinors wing their ssight across the reos,
Restored to peooe : Fuith dreads to be rebuked :

With no foul deod is the christe household sullied:

' Muuners ond law hove eooh durk spotted sin

Oruoh’d end expell’d ε our infuuts' mothers win
Appleuse for offepriu'g like unto their sires:

And retribution dogs the poth oi crime
Its sure oompuuiom who would crouoh before
The Parthian foemonl Who the Tartar horel η
who ’neoth the brood grisly Germania bears,

With (leesor sootholess'l Who a thought would give l
To wild Iberia’s warl anh one doth olooe

The dayupon hie native hille and wooes
The vine reductive to the unwodded trees:
