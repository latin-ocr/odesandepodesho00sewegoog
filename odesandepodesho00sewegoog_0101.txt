omes oh nome.

Fer onestretoh’d madly feam between
Troy end Reme, on eny shore
Heppy let the exiles reign 3
Whjle the eettle tremple 0'er
Priem's end Peris’ sepulchre,
And the wile beeste herbour there

Their eubs unvengeh Glittering stand
The Capitol, end Rome have sway

Laws eo diepense with haughty hand
O’er Medie's triumph-led array.

Wide-fear’d‚ her neme o'er sexhhes'e shores
Extend she-where the eentrel deep
Dieeevere Europe from the Moor 3—
Where ewelling Nile ite leae doth sheep :
More bold to seem gold undieelosed,

And thus more heppily repeseeh

When eethh eonceels it, then with hand,
Which every hellow'd thing doeh rob,

T' emese it for a mortal'e end„
Whahever Emit of the globe

Hath barr'd e paesege, thie yelad
In arms, echieve she-joy’d ho view
In what pan firee ere revelling med,
In what the miste end ehow’ry dew.

. But te the wem'or sens of Rome

Beneehh ehis bend I read their doom,

· Theb ne'er too duteoue, and with joy

Confidhng in their high estate,
The roofs of their ancestral Troy
They sein desire to reinstaee.
