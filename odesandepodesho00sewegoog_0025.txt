So may tho goddess power that prnm swoys,
So Helen’s brothers, stam of light,

And he· the somn Fathor of sach breem,
Guido thos on thy course srlght:
Gyved all ond pfflon’d, save ·
Him of Iapygia’s wavo ;

ank ! which with virgil tmsood to thy saith
Art charged, wast him book, I prsy,

Unto the Attio bourns unsouoh'd by sosthe,
And save my own life's moiety.

That man had oak and tliploplss'tod mail
Bucklsring his bross, who first

Iaunoh’d on the savsge doep his shallop smil,
Nor Siroo fear'd of headlong burst,

Holding it· tourney with tho Northwinds keen,
Nor the rueful Hyades,

Nor the South’s wrassh, than whom of Hadsia's main
N ο despot mightier there is
To hoave iss depths, or, if he fain,
To lay them to repose again.

As what sppmsoh of death appall'd was he,
who floating monsters saw below

With tesrlsss eyes, who saw tho billow)⁷ ses„
And rocks of legendary voe,-

The high CerauniansW Prescient Hoaven in vain
By th’ estranging deep eaoh shore
