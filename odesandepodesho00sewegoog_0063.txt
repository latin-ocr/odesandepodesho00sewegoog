Beamdmphg bolts and wedges bearing
In hand of brass-nor distant far
Is griping hook and molten lead„
Ἠιθο Hope attende and Honour mre,
With patches mantled white as snow3

Nor doth her oommde she foreg0‚

Though with changed garb, 'ohe great man’s halls
Thou quit in deadly enmity 3

While faithless crowd, and peq‘ured queau
Away retire. Dispersed fly

With dmg-dmin’d cesla, the fn'ends too full

of guile, in paim the yoke 'no pulL

O save thou Oaesar, soon to pass
'Mongst Erimus, the remotest men
01 earth, and that fresh-levied band
Of spin'ts in their prime, which then
By eastern regions must bo view'd
With terror, and the on'mson flood.

AJas! For all our scats and crime,

Shame, ahma! and for our brothers [alain 1]
What have we shnmk imm? We, an age

Of harden'd hema 1 What deed of sin

Forbidden have we left undrajn’dv
Whenoe have our youth their grasp refiain'd,

By sear ο1 gods? What holy shfines ,
E'er have they sparedss Ο would to Heaven
That on an anvil newly planted,
Ο Portum, thou wouldst hammer even

And sharpen out our blunted swords
’Gainst Massaget, and 'Arab hordes.
