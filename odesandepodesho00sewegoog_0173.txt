But if a yokemnte chesne 10 bear her part, Ι

Assist his household and his darling boys
(Such an a Sabine dame, or one, tnnn’d thoroughly
with suns, a stouthemed Apulinn's mate),
And pile with nged logs the marth-fite holy,
The eoming of her wearied sponse to great 3 ,
And, folding in their wnttled pens the Idne
Sloek fed, may dmin their wide-strebch’d udders dsy 3
And [nom sweet bamel bronching this year's wine,
Serve up repnsts which gold did never buy 3
Let not the shell tribe os the Luon‘ne lake,
Or turbon, or the soar delight me more, ’
If w'mter any, when it thundering breaks
On eastern naves, to this sea chunos 0’er,
Let not the bird of Afric’s region, not
Ionia's woodeook, with more gunt to plenae,
Demend into my maw hhan ofive got
Ohoice from the richost branchos of my trena,
Or blado of lapathus that loves 'ohe mend,
And mallows healthful to the frame disemed 3
Or on the festive Terminnls doom'd '00 bleed,
A lamb, or kidsmg from the wolf just seimd.
Midst these repasts how· charming ’tis to view
The sheep from pannum homeward quiek repant!
To view the steens with collon drooping low
Outwearied drngging the inverted ahane !
And my domestica, busy swanm, the token
Of n nich houmhold3 laid to their repone,
The fine-bmght Lares round l Thus having spoken
The muner Alfius„ on the spot prepam'ng
ΜΜΜΜ,
Ἀ farmer he,
Upon the Ides drew all his money in 3
And on the Galends seeks fio place it out agm'n
