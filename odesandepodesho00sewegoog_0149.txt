E’en in such spirit Drusus [heom]
As ’neoth tho Rhoetion Alps ho vagos
His vars, the Vindelico have soen :
(Whoso sashion whenoo deduood through ages,
Still their right hands against attacks
Arme with tho Amazonion axe,

I have deferr’d to question hero5
Nor may we ken of every brath),
But squadrons long, and fas and noar
Viotorg by oounsels of a you'oh
O’eroomo, have learnt what mind oould do·—
What native worth, with mining duo

Nursod in heav'n-blost bowors spart :

What towards youthfiss Noros shov'd
Augustus’s paternal hemo

Bravo fiom tho bravo aro born and good 3
There lives in steen, them lives in aboedo
The virtue of their pavonts’ broeds.

Neither do engles fieroe beget
A tim’rous dove. But toachers’ skill
Doth inborn powers advanoe and whet,
And n'ght tilohs hardy bosoms oteol:
Where mannen e‘or hath proved a ἀθετῶ,
Oximes defonn things of noble bisol»

What unto Nemo thou dost owe,
Rome! doth M etaurum’s stream attest,
And Aodmbal in battle low
O'ervanquioh'd ς and that day no bleso
Which (clouds dispell'd from Iotium’s sky)
First smiled with bolmy victory.
