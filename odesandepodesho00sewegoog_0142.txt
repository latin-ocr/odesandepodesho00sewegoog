11011101εά, of more enduring power
Thnn bronze, and lostier than the site
Of pyramide by monerehs’ pight3
Which not oonoding rein ean wreek‚
Not Boreae, masierlees and week,

Or the innumerable chain

Of yeem, end flight of seesons [vain].

From Inbitinn still shnll I,

With lendings of posteritys

Wax great in ireshness, eli the iimo,
While up the Capitol 111111 elimb¹
The priest, with virgin of maid iongue
All silent. I shall still be sung,
Where fuiious Aulidus deth rear ’
Ageinst iie benks, end Daunus, poor
In streame, the 111111 natione sway’d;

Puissnni 5-0hief in having woo’d‚
And mnnied the AEolinn ode

Το Lniien mensures, Put thou on
*The haughty port by meiii won,

And giudgelees with the Delphic bey
Beli thou my looks, Melpomene.
