ODE XV.
To eunome
Ucwr posuperie I byei.
Peme Ibyeus's wife,
To thy good-for-nothing life,

. And thy seandalous labour'd trieks

Do at lengbh a limie fix;
Bordering ae thou emt [too sure]
On a funeral mature.

Oeaee midst virgin girls to frolie,
And e vapour melancholia

O'er the gliet’ring stem to throw.
Noe, if tolerably so

Aughe becometh Pholoe,
Ohlorie too, becomes ie thee :
She, the daughter, better far,
Gellante', houses storms in wer,
Like a Baeehent, fremy-amitten.
Soon as tembourine is beaten 3
Her like wauton kid and brisk
Nothus' love compels to frisk 3
Thee the fleeces shorn emund
Lueefie the far renown'd‚

N ot the harpe, or purple bloom
Of the rose, nor caeles drein'd home
To dregs, abeldmn thee beeome.
