On mo doth gaze, or oaprioom, ‘
The despot of th’ Hesperian flood ;

Fuch stur, that ruled when we wore born,
Doth sympathia in wond’rous momh

Theo J ove's bright tutehry ray
me impious saturn anatoh’d away,

And shay’d those wings of rapid pace,

The wings of fate, what timotheir shout
of joy the thronging populace

Thn'oe in the theatre rung out.

Me tho toee's tnmk, which stealthy slid
Dounon my hrain, hud strichen dead,

Except that with his own n'ght hund
Faunus had lighten’d off the blow :

He, Power protective of the hand
To Mercmy deur. Remomber thou

Victima and votive fane to pay,
We, lowly giu, a lumb will slay.
