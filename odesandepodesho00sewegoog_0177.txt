Wild fig-treee out of tombs uprootech
Bidr cypressos for burials remed,
And greeoed with blood of tadpole foul

Ήιο spown, and down of night sereeehowl,

And druge lolehos' soil produoes‚

And she, the rife with poison juieee
Iberia 3-h0nee‚ too, with a snateh
Torn hom the jews of stervling breche,
All be to ashes burnt with fire

Of Oolehee. While in light attire

For aetion, the whole mansion through,
Sagana eprinhling hellieh dew,

Is brietling up with elfin wig,

Like o see hedgehog er bear pig
&herging eho hun'oer. Vei», not
Seered by one eonscientious thought,
Out of e grove was sorahbling soil
With hard hoes, grunhng o’er the toi] ;
Thae there inierr’d the livelong day
The bey might pine eud die away
Before the epecteoIe of fieeh

Twiee end three times oeploeed artesii,
And whilom with his mouth might simin
Forwerd ee far, ae by the ehin
Suspended bodies peer above

When on the interdieted fere

Hed wither'd in their sookete Nor
Ther one was absent—ohe of more
