ODE xxxma

w ms commone,
ano eat ῠῶοτιώιωη

Now must we dm‘n the gobletQ-—now
Must earth be struck with lib’ral trem
Now for the Sanan priests to deok
The gods’ divan, with banquets spread,
comulas and fn'ends, it were the tim03
Before this hour it seem'd a crime

Forth from our gmndsisos' oells to draw
Our Goecub wine 3 while frantie min,
The queen against the Capitol,
And death against the throne was broving-
she, with her filthy etmuch'd om·
of men, with ailments foul to view-

she, impotent of sou] to cherish
Any dream of hope she would,

And with her sugas’d fortune drunk.
Yet still her frenzy hot it oool’d ε

Swoe one solitasy mil

From the fires survived and hail.

And her mina with idle panio

'Neath the Mmotic juioe
scarad, into terrore ‘stem

And mal, Oaesar did reduce, ·
As from Itali& she was νίψῃς,-
He close with bam upon her spn‘nging
