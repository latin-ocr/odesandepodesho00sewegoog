He onvos reposo in strong desito
Tantalus Pelop'o faithless siro,

Ihoking sor ayo the boon repant :

Orovos it Prometheus, chained fust

Unto tho vulture ι omos in want,

Upon the mountain's orest ; but still

J ovo's lawa forbid it. Thou shalt feel
Tho wish one hour from some high pile
’10 plunge thoe down; another while
With Non‘o stool that bremt 01 thino

To broaoh And vainly 011011 thou twine

In loothing sioklinoss 01 soul.

And earth itsolf shall yield before

My haughtinoss, Must I, who power
Possoss o’on imogos 01 wax

To move, as thou host learnt, 01 hoto

=Down by my charmings from tho ephoro ;
Gon miso the dead though homo with fite,
And brew tho oup of strong desire :

Most I lament for witohory
