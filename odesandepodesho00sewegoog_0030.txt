ODES OF nomon.

ODE v11.
‘ro memus emens
laedam alie
Omns shell laud the glorious Rhodes,
Or Mitylen, or Ephesus,
Orthe rempire wells of Oon'nth,
Seated 011 its sister fioods;

Or Thebes by Bacchus blezon’d vide,
Or the Delphis peaks by Phoebus,

' Or Thessehen Tempe'e veles ,

There ere, whose single tesk it is,
In one unbroken minstrel song,

Το chent hhe tovers of teintless Pelles,
And upon their hrovv to fix
The olive eull'd from every theme.

Many e hard to J uno’s homage
Tells of Asgos, soil for steeds,
And the n'cheen‘fe Myeenae.

Me heth neither half es much
Hesdy Imedaemon mitten,

Nor so mueh the chempeign weelthy
Of [ev-isse, es the gmeo

Of the echoing Albunea,
And the heedlongshooting Anio,

And Tibmnus' hallow'd grove,
Audies orcherds ever dewy

With their twinkhng rivulets

As hom derkling heaven above
Notus seir is esttimes sweeping

Olouds, nor doeh engender showers
Ever during 3 so do thou
