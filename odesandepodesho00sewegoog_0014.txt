the ohservations which have impressed on my own mind so
strongly the importance 01 introducing into classical edn-
cation the practice of translation at once literal and rhyth-
1111011.

1. 01 the velue 01 111101 aocuracy, and minute attention 10
grammatical construction, it is not unnecessary 10 speak.
The University 01 Oxford stillrequires it. But along expe-
rience as 1 tutor compels me 10 1011 thet it is decaying
incur schools. It is 1 fact which Ι can vouch for, 110111
my own experiencc, that in by far the largest number of
young men who enter the University, there is scarcely any
such habit. Tenses are substituted 101 tenses, cases 101 cases,
words carelessly disturbed 110111 their order, conjunctione
coniounded, prepositions omitted or inserted at will, particles
,treated es nonentities, all the nice discriminations 01 suffixes
neglected ; and nearly the first year 01 the University course
is required 101 going over this elementary ground, and cor-
recting something 01 the carelessness whichhasbeen permitted
or encouraged 11 school.

The eriplanation 01 this evil is to be found, 1101 in the
negligence 01 incompetence 01 masters. Far 110111 it. Ferit
prevails in schools where the teachers are 01 the highest
attainmcnts, and 111011 sedulously devoted 10 their work
But it is attributable to the consciousness 01 the sad effeots
which flow from accrrstoming a boy 10 view the great models
01 classic-al poetry through the medium 01 his own bare
prosaic translation, and 01 allowing him 10 travestie them in
bad English. To escape from this into a free and elegant
translation, he is indulged in grammatical liberties And
thus the habit 01 accuracyis sacrificed‚ and a slovenly scholar-
ship overlooked and even encouraged. Το reconcile the two
things striot accuracy and something 01 1 poetical character,
is very difficult indeed 11 the spur 01 the moment. For my

own classes I found it necessary 10 make such translations
