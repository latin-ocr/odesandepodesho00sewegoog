0111111] ODES OF Houucu.

chr yc 1 or doth my eoul
Delude some eweet dclii-ioue epc'llt
. Methinke Ι voices hear, and rovc 11 will
Through hudow’d groves of sainted spirite full,
’Neoth which both pleasant riiis ond breezy zephyro roih

For me, while wand'ring o’er
Apuliun Vultur, past the bourn .
of myApuliun foster-hnd, outworu
With oport and eloep in boyhood'e hour,
Wove there of foliage strange the subled dovee 1 bower.

(sight which might well bc todo
Of marvel unto 111, whoe’er
Τ111 Acherontie’e neetled humlct share,
And Bantium’u forest glades, and 1111111
Rich of Forentum’e town, low-seutod in its 11111)

How elumb’ring I did lie,
With limbo from ripere bleolr sofelrept,
And beare 3 how both in hollow'd bey was mpt,
And myrtle spreye cull'd from each thioket nigh,
Not without eid of heov’n, 1 epritefid infant Ι,

Ι, votcry of your power
Ye Muses 1 votory of you,
Asccnd amid Sabinum’e mountain orcw 3
Or if slope Tibur, or Praeneete frore,
Or Bciae's oryetcl streame hove chmm’d me tho more.

Unto your well-springs mo
And to your ohoire devoted, not
Tho battle 11 Philippi putto mut,
Did quenoh iu death 5 not the occurred trec,

Not Palinurus whelm'd in the Sicilion 111Ι
