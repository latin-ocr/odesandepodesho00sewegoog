ODES 01³ HORACE.

Teeming with en'me, hath age on age

Oui bridais first, and lineage,

And household hearths been sullying5
And, streaming down from this well-spn'ng¹
Swept like a flood hath desolation

In on our fathers' land and nation.

Not stom such parents sprung as these
Did our young manhood stain the seas
With Punic blood, and slew for us
Pyrrhus and huge Antiochus,

And Hanniba] cursed3 but a yield,
Like men, of soldiers from the field ;

Taught with their Sabine hoes to turn

The alode, and osa mother stem

The will obeying, home io list

The axfflopp'd siukei when Sol might shift
The mountain shadows, and their yokes
Remove from many a wearied ox,

Slow dmwing on that hour of oharm
With car reireating. Fraughi with hami
What hath time fail’d to impairi

ν Our fathers' generation far

Worse than our grandsires us did bear
More worthless‚—m heneeforth about

A guiltier issue to send oui.
