ODES OF HORACE.

Evory faoe ι ghastly pale,

And their strick'n spin'ts quail
All bowilder'd: So it is 3

'Tin our bitter destinies

Romu mula that hamt and θοαὶ,
And the gunt of brothers’ blood:

Since the gore of Remus, ill
Men'ting his fate, did well

Το the gwund with execratione
qught to coming generations„

Ο vm Ooecubian juioe, stored by

For festival mgales, shall I,

ffiumphant in our victor loni,

Oaesar, beneath thy dome, high tower’d
(Thus ploeaed it Jove that it should be)
Thou bless'd Maeoenas, quaff with thee ς
The while the lyra rings forth a lay.
Mingled with flutas—in Dorian key
The lym, a stt-ain barbm'ie they? .

As late, when chased across the main,
The chief Neptunian fied amain,

His navy giv'n to flames in threat
When he had shnken 0'er the state
Gyves‚ which from slaves a truitor band
Stripp’d had h& 3 their aooomplioe hand
Romam (asaal posterity

Ye to the tale will give the lie !)
