oon xv.] ODES OF Honhcn. 21

Vein shelter’d under Venue' shield,
Fieree sheit thou oomb thy looks, end measure,
On hnrp unknown to battle-field,
Ditties thy henem train to pleeeure!
Veinly in thy bridal bower
Buried ehnlt thou sktflk end eower

From the mesey speetu, end stinge
Of tho Gnoeeien med, end roar

. 0f sight, end Ajax cled with winge
To chose thee. Yet eles! in honr
Far too lete thou shalt and must
Deub thy adulterer looks in dnet.

See’et not Ulyeses et thy reor, Ι
Hisn, perdition of thy ranei

Not Pylien Nestori Lost to fear,

Dogging oloee thy steps they poete—
Thee‚ Selemininn Teucer, thee,
Sthenelus, in battle frey

Deepeehool’d or if need he there,
Hie steeds to mle in lordly guiso,
He no eluggond chaneteer.
Men'on too shnlt thou egnize.
Lot tounenrththeefoemsonfim
Tydides, nobler then hie sire 3

From whom, like hert the wolf before,
On the glen’e fai-ther bank dieeern'd,
Reehlese of grass thou off ehelt eoour,
With geeps from head on high upturn'd
Minion ἔ to thy ehoeen moid
Not these professione having made.
