ODES 01³ nomen.

The elder os the Nem pair

Did next the heavy shook of war

In oonfiiot plunge, and [fmm the field}
With favoun'ng auspiooe repell’d

The Rhaetian mvngery-he

In the dmd lists of chivulry,

Fit mark for every gam, to note

With what fleme nhoeks he wearied out
Brome vow’d unto a freeman’s grave ;
E'en as th’ indomitable wavo

Auster is soourging, when the train

Of Pleiade oleaves the clouds in tvaim

No dull and listless warrior ho

Το scaro the foemen's ohivalry,

And plunge his snorting oharger thsough
The midst of buminga Even so
BuH-fronted Aufidus rolls on,

He who the kingdoms flow along

of Daunus tho Apulian, when

He ravos, and on the labour’d plain

A deluge horrible designs : ι

E'en as the wfld barbafims' lines

Of pluited mail did Claudius bunt,
And shiver with wild shoek 3 and first,

And marmost mowing down, the ground
Strew'd, victor without loss or wound :
Theo fomes leading, thoe alone

Oounsel, and deities thino¹ own.

For on that day, when-eon [of yore]

Did AJexandsia, bow'd before

[mom.
