ODE XL

mo Qum’nus mmm

Que'd bellicam amabe.
Wlm· the cantabam hot for war,
And Tartar herde, dispmed far
By Adria's barrier, plene diseerd,
Hirpinus Quintius, to regaoed
With eurious search ; nor fret with nerve
startljng and quiek a life to serve,
Thet makes but few demands„ Apaee
Flies past us lighewing’d youth, end grece ;
While wither'd homy eld doeh fright ·
Awey wfld loves, end elumber light.
There dwells not in the spring-tide flower
The seme bn’ght glory ev'ry hour.
Nor shines the moon in erimson fire
With but one visege. Wherefore tire
Thy eoul, ὺοο weak for such e mk,
With plane eternity that mk?
Why not beneath some foliage high—
Plane, wilt thole—er this fir-tme nigh?
Reclining thus in lex reposo,
Our grey hm'rs scented with the rose,
And nard Aseyxien, while we may,
Gerouse we, bathed in unguente [gay] 2
Evius doth matter to the eir
Oorroding gn’efe What pege will there
Quickest the fiexy Felem’s glessee
slake in the clear stream as it pasees?
who fmm her home will angling be
Lyde, that weyward herlotryss
