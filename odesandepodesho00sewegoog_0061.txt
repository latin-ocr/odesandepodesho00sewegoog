ODE XXXIV.

mmm m mtonffla
Poroue Dwmom.

I Bm a votary poor of Heavon,
And raro attendant for the past,
While osa wild philosophy
I stroy professor, now at last

To book my soils am doom’d perforoo,
And traco agam my quittod course,

For 0st and ost tho Sire of day,
Splitting tho clouds with lightning glore,
Throughout the orystal sky hath driven
His thund'ring stoods and winged ssffl'i
Whoroot brute earth, and wand'fing floods,
Whoroat tho Styx, and dread abodos

Of loathod Taenarus, and bounds
Atlantio ahuddor to their base.

The Deity bath might 'oo change
Lowoet, for things of highest place ;

And wastos away tho blozon'd knight,

Dmgging forbh ‹bsknoss into light.

Hence, from one head with mvem'ng gmsp,

With rush of pinions loud and shn'Jl,
Fortuno tho oront hath borno alost ;
Here joys to plaoo it down at will.
