A boy, too, of hundrods of 1111,

Far end wide will 111 bear uround
The standurds of thy oempnign

And whensoe’er having won his ground
O'er his competitors' bribes

Prone, he heth lough’d in joy, beside
The lnke of Albanum he'll ploos

Theo enshrined in marble pride,
Under 1 oitron 1111111

Here nt thy nostrils 111111 thou respire
Frunkinoense rich, and be oharm’d

With many 1 mingled 1111111 oi the lyre
And Berecynthinn pipe,

Not without flute. There twice e day
Boys with the delicate maids

Inuding thy mighty divinity,
Thrioe with 1 footstep of snow,

In salian feshion, 111111 shake the ground.
Me neither (11111111 now,

Nor the trustful hope of responsiva love,
Nor to enter the lists in wine

Delights 3 nor with ohnplet fresh 1ο twine
My temples But why, 1111 1

Why, Iigurine, o'er my oheeks is weiling
The slow intermitting tear 1

Why fluent 1111, in 1 silence, little
Grooefirl, while Ι am speaking,

Felters my tongue 1 In dreams of night
Now I 1 prisoner hold thee,

Now swift in flight I pursue thee over
The swerd of the Martian plain

Thee, hardeshem, through the midst of* 1111111 1

Rolling away before thee.
