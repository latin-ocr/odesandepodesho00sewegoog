ODE XXII.

ho Amemus Fuscus

Imeyer vitae.
Tm mqn intaot of life, and clear
Of trespasss, lacks not Moorish shafts,
Nor bow, nor quiver, hhxseus, womb'd
With venom'd arrowa-
Whether proposed his path to take
Through seething Syrnos or the wfld
Unshelten'ng Caucasus, or reahns
Which the Hydaspffl,
That legend-haunted stream, doth lave.
For me in Sabine wood a wolf,
While my own Lalage 1 chant,
And o’er my sunit,
From camos untrammell'd, free am roving,
ssed, though unam’d-—a monster such
As neither Daunia, herffland,

Its beeoh-groves wide

Withjn, doth seed, nor Juba’s realm
Doth gender,—she the sun-scorch'd nurse
Os lions. Plaoe me where in plains

Lifeless and dull,

No single tree by summer’s breeze

Is freshen'd-qumer of the globo

Which sogs and noxious Jove oppresses 3-
Plaoe me beneath

The oar of sol too nigh, on ground

Denied to man’s abodes. ΙἸΙ love

My Lalage, the sweetly smfflng,
The sweetly speaking.
