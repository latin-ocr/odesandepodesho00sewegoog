ODES OF HORACE.

ODE XVII„

*vomam

Velox wmoewwm oaepe.

Swm Faunus ost doth change his haunt
To sweet Lucretilis, from vales

Lycaean, and doth bid avaunt
The fiery heat, and showery galea

Still from my ewen Throughout'the grove
Secum, as from the path they πονο,

sse lmking arbutus, and bank
of thymo, are searching out unhmm’d
The harem of the husband rank ε
Nor'me the little kids almm'd
At emerald snakes, nor wolves of war,

Whene’er my Tyndan‘s [afar]‚

With dulcet pipe have rung the glenS,

· And marble cliffs of soft recljned
Ustica„ Me ’tis heaven defends ;

Το heaven my holiness 01⁴ mind
And Muse is beart-loved, Here for thee,
Rich with the treasures os the lea,

Ful] to the brim shall Plenty well
From horn of bounty. Here the fim
Of Sirius in sequester'd dell
shalt thou eschew 3 and on a lym

Of Teos, thou the pair shalt sing
On one loved object labouring,

[noox ι,
