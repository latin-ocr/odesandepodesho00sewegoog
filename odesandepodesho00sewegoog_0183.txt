ons m] ODES OF HORACE. 163

Thrull'd to a woman hs's fascino,
And arms our soldier bears, and e’en
“ Unto a wrinkled eunuch erew

Brooks to be slave: While Sol doth view

Rused umid standards of the fight

The foul gunt-curtam. At this sight

Geuls twice a thousand wheel'd about

Their suerting chargers, peuling out,

“ Oaesar ;’' and in the hsven hid ,

Sculk poops of foemen’s vessels sped

To leftwsrd. Io triumph! [ssy‚]-

Dost thou the ears of gold deley,

And heifers, unprofsned by touch?

Io triumphe! neither such

A chieftaiu fmm J ugtuths's fighe

Home diust thou eonvny, nor the hight

Greet Affleenus-him for whom

Valour 0’er Osrthsge piled a tomb.

Vanqsush’d on lund sud sea, the foe

Hes ts'en the sagum, gerb of woe f -

'Steed of his purple. Either he

Το Crete, that isle of proud renown,
- With its twioe fifty towns, doeh fles,
To ses] with breezes nob' his own 3

Or bo the Syme, ’neuth tho seeurge

of Notus void, his comes doeh urge ,·

Or swept 'is 0'er sn simless surge.

Bigger oups here, boy, and produce

The Ohisn or the Lesbisu juiee! .

Or what may floeting qualms restreiu,

Measure us forth the Qaeeubsn.

All esre end fesr for Oaessr's state,

With sweet Lyaeun druughsss 'tis joy so dissipate.
