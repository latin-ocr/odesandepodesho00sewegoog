ODES OF HORACE.

And in fair seasons, and in waning
Uprighss 3 of fraud that thimts for pelf
chastiser, and from gold abstaining
That draggeth all things to itself3
And oonsul not of one short year,
But osten as the judge prefer

Right to the uwfiss—he of saith

And virtue proven,-—and with brow
Sublime hm eost into their teeth

The guilty's bribes, and vietor now
Through squadrons {ming bold his ehmge,
His legions bath deployed at large.

Not to the lord of much the name

Of bloet wilt thou have n'ghtly given ;
More rightly he that name doth claim

Of blest, who cantho gista of heaven
Use wisely, and hard penmy beas,
And guilt e'en worse than death doth sear
He for the friends whom he doth cherish‚
Or counny, not afraid to perish.
