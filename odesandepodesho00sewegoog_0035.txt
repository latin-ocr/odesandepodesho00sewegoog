Tnou sees’o how Soracte stand&

. Ghss’d over with its depth of snow ,·

Nor may the groaning labouring woods
Hold up beneath their burden now 3

And streams in massas 'naath tho foroe

Of the sharp frost have sbopp’d their course.

Thaw thou the oold 3 with bounteous hand
The loge upon thy hemah-fite heaping 3
§nd kindlier draw from Sabine jar
Thy luscious wine of four years’ keeping3
0 Thaliarchus! all beside
Surrender to the gods to guido.

For, soon as they have laid tho winda
That battle fieren with mething ooean,
Nor oypmaees, nor mountain ash
Umeworn are toss'd in wild commotion.
what on to-morrow there shall be,
Fschew from searching euriously.

And what amount of days thy lot

shall grant thee, set it down bo gam 3
Nor do sshou sweet delicious loves,

Nor danoes, thou a boy, (111111Δί113
While from thee, in thy sprh1g·tide gay,
Hoar churlinh eld afar doth stay.
