Persicon odi, puer.

1 mmm, my boy, the pompe paradod
By Persian art. They please me not-—
Of phillym thy ohaplets braided.
(leuse hunting of all spots in what ,
There lingers still the rose late waning

1 care not thou shouldst task'd refine
Aught on the artless myrtle wreath ,·
Nor theo, apage, tho myrtle twine
Doth misbeoome,-nor me, boneath
My close pleach’d vine tho goblet dmining.
