Now haoh tho Siro enough of snow
And hoilsoorm dread lounoh'd o’or the lond3
And having on our hollow’d tovers

Hath soored tho city-ooarod tho 1111110111,
Los’o Pynha’s grievous age revivo:
Hor who of monsters strange bewajl’d hor,
When 111 his herd did Proteus dn‘ve
The losty mountain orosto 1ο visit 3
And tangled was tho finny drove
In the olm top, which (11111 had boon
Familior haunt for mamr a dovo 5
And on tho tide o'ormonoling sprood,v
Floatod tho does 111 panio dread.
Soon have wo amber Tibor rushing,

Too soro, ho vounts him vongoauoo-givor,
And on his lost bonk lawless glidos,

They, by their fathers* vioe and sin,
A monhood 1111111111 wido and 111111.
