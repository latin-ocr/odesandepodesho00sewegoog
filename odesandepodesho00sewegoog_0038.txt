18 ODES oh Holmon. [uoox ι.

He, whether Parthia's hosts on latium hovering¹

In triumph just before him he hath driven,
Tamed to the yohe 3 or Serio tribes and Inda
Cast ’naath the region of the Orient heav’n-

He‚ less than thoe alone, the wido-spmad globo
Shall rulo in justioe Thou, with pond'rous mr,

Shalt make Olympus trembley-thou on grovos
But little holy hunoh thy levin-holte of war.

ODE XIIL

me m, hydia.

Wm, Lydia thou dost lauding speah
of Telephus's rose-flush’d neck,

of Telephus's arms, with sheen

As fair as wax-woe, ποθ !-·my sploen
Hoh burning swelle with chohing hile.
Then neither hhoughh in me the while,
Nor colour ‘m a fixod plave

Abideth z and with semet traoe

The marmop on my choeks is shealing-
With what slow fims I wasto reveahmg
Deep in my bremt. I burn [and pine],
Whether intemp’rate brawls with wine
Thine iv’ry shoulders have defiled ς

Or on thy lips, with pmion wild,

Tho boy with tooth has stamp’d a mark
Remember’d long. No, if thou harh
To me enough, Ο, hope thou never,
what he will oonsbomt prove for ever,
