Wm striphng slim, on hodo of rohes,
Bathed in liquid odours, wooos theo,
Pyrrha, in some delicious groth
For whose ploooure mo thou binding
Book thy flowing looks of gold,
Axtloss in graoeful nicetiesh
Woel howofhshohlhehewoffing
Th)y honour, ond his oltor'd gods!
And on sooo with murky tempests
Rough‚ shall marvel to his fill,
All unused to such o sight. ’
He who now too fondly trusting,
Enjoyo thee in hhy golden hour ‚·
Who soih disongagod, soih lovnIy,
Hopes to find thoe, recldng nought
Of the treoohorous broozo. Ο hopless
They, to whom untried thou shinost!
As for me, with votive tablot,
The hollow'd wall dohh show that Ι

Have my dripping garb suspended
Unto tho god who mles the sea.
