one x.] ODES OF HORACE.

LYmA:
Though he is feirer then a sear,
Thou lighter than a corle and prone to ire,
More then the wicked Adria-
With thee I'd joy to live-with thee would fain expire.

Eaemmwn Toma'im.

Ο, Lm! though thou wert dn'nking
Remobest Tanais, wedded there
Unto a sevege sponse :
Yet to expone me,
Streteh’d at my length before thy ruehless deora,
Unto ‘ohe native Aquilo&
Sure wouldst thou weep. ·
Hark! with what din the gete-—
With what a din the grove,
, Midae thy fair helle imphnted, eo the winde
Rebellows‚ end how Jove
The deep-imbedded snows·
With bfight mystelline power is ieing 0’er.
Ley thou thy heughtiness aeide,
Unloved of Venus ;
Lesb, as the wheel runs round,
The rope reeoiL
Not a Penelope to wooers harah
Did a Tyrrhenian father thee beget.
