Uuou my fiiends would I hestow,
Puterae end bronzes fuir te show,
My Censorino, with oomteous spi1it3

Of velient Greeians 3 nor shouldst thou
Beer off the pettiest end most low
Of ull my gists, if I were fich,

Sooth so to sey, in ests, the whieh
Either Parrhasius brought to light,
Or Seopes, oue of emh end might

In stone, und oue in liquid dyes-
Now men, now God before our eyes
