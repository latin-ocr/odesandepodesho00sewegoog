hcm, when I myuels was fain

'Po tell of ware and citios ta’en,

With harah-struck lyre my mndness ohid,
Im 1 my puny sails should spmd
Aaron the Tynheno main. Thy days,

0 ΟΜ, both anto our leas

Their toomhg hmests have mered,
And unto Jove our favouring Inrd
Planted oneo more ssho standards torn

Down fmm tho Parthian's gates of soom
And Quirin’s «Ianus they have closed,

⁴ Now olomsed from baulos, and imposed
curba on lieentious wild abusa
hom righteous rule late wanderhg loona
And banish'd far each guilty ιωὶιι,
And eall'd back pristine arbs again:

Arts wherewithal the Latian name,

And powers Italian wax’d in same,

And far the empire's glory spread,

And gmndeur, from the western bed

Of sol unto his place of birth

With Ooesar guardian of the emh,

Not civil fiemy, οι brute forne,

§hall rob us of our peaoefill oourse.

Not wrath, which forges brands for blows,
And piteous citios turns to foen„
