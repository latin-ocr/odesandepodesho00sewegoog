ODE 11.
To momus Imm
Pindmmm quisqm'a evadet.
Wnosoz'mz Pindar studieth to rival,
beans upon pinions by the arb of Daedal
Waxed‚ Iulus, ready to give titles
To the glass'd ocean.
E’en as a torrent from a mountain hurljng,
Which raim have fed its wonted margin over,
Pindaoeus boile, and rushes on with mouth of
Deep-rolfing thunder.
He to be gifted with Apollo’s laurel,
Whether, along his dithyrambs audaoious,
N ew-minted words he sweepeth and in numbers
Iawless is hum'ed:
Or <loth of gods or monarche sing, the blood of
Goda, by whose prowess perish’d in a righteous
Murder the Centaurs-pefish'd the fiame of
Deaffly Ohimaera ;
Or those, whom palm of Elis home is leads'ng,
Rm'sed to the aldes, or pugifist or comer,
N ameth, and gists them with a boon more rich than
Hundreds of statues„
Or doth he wail a spirit in its manhood
Rest from his weeping oonsoxss ; and his vigour,
Soul too, aud goldeu manners raiae to heav'n‚ and
Grudgo to black Orous
Copious the br'eeze, which lifts the swan of Dirce,
0st as he sonte, Anbonim, into losty
mend-regiona I, in faflhion and in guise of
Bee of Matinum,
