ODE VIII
wo mmm
Ulla eijm tib&
Ir but one pain for pel-jurad tro’oh
Had brought thee ham, Barim, e’er-

. If by blank tooth οι· single nail
Thou wart beooming uglier ε

rd trust ,· but thou, when thou hast bound
With νοντα thy false head, fm'ser far

Ast glitt'flng out, and issuest forth
of an our youth the genem] cara

It <ioth besbead thee to forswear
Ἧι] mother’s ashes sepultured 3

And night's stffl stare, with heav'n entire,
And gods from ioe-oold death secure&

Venus herself at this, I say,

Doth smila-the amless nymphe do smile 3
And Oupid fierce his fixe-shafts pointing

On bloody whetstone all the while.

Add that our youth entire grows round Ihee-
Grows a new wlago-and thmlls,

Who served thee emt, though oft they menacess
Quit not their godless tymnt's halle.

Theo, mothers sor their youthful steers—
Thee, frugal cronos and maidens doead-

ead, though new-wedded-lest thy breath
Delay their spouses [from their bed}
