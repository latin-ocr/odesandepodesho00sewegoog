Trust me, not sprung from the unholy vulgos,
Is she loved by thee ; nor could one so feithfiil,
So luere-loething, ever spiing from mother

Fit to he blush’d for.
Ι oon her anns, and lineaments, und tep’xing
Limbs unnffected flatter 3 hate suspeoting

One, whose life just has trembled on the point to
Closs his eighth lustre.

ODE V.
Nomium schotti.

Non yet heth she the strength to bear
The yoke, with neck subdued;

Not yet the tasks to satisfy
of thy yoke·fellow.
ᾗ {¹ ff ἃ ὕ ¹1·
Thy heifers’ thoughts ore wend’ring round
Sovannshs green, in rivers now
The burden of the heat reheving ς
Now in some stream-fed willow bower,
With younglings of the kine
Dolighting more then all to frolio.
Hence with thy passion for th' unmellow'd grape 3
soon to thy hand shall autumn,
With all its vaiied tints,
Mottle tho clusters blue with purple stein:
soon will she follow thee.
For on there runs the fieroe oereeiing time,
And unto her will add the years
Which it heth ta'en from theo.
