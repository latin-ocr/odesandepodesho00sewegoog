Does, then, the sleep etern of death
Quintilius whelm‘i Το whom, 0 when
Shall Modesty and unbribed thh,
Sister of J ustioe, and, io man
Unveiled Tmth an oqui-l find ἲ
He died by many a noble mind

Bewept—more surely wept by none
Thau by thyseli', my Virgii Thou,
As fond and duteous as a son
Vainly, [das l· art mking now
of Heaven Quintilius 1 not on terma
Like these intrusted to thino arm

What though with more of witcheties
Thau Tbndan Orpheus, thou a sheli
Attune, e’en listen'd to by trees,
Ne’er can the blood return io swell
Thai phantom visionmy form,
Which onoe with wind of shuddering oham, Ι

He of no mercy io unlock
’ The fatos io prayers, he, Mercury,
Hath driven to join his sablo flock
Hard dte i Yet that doth leam to be

Lighter by patiendo, whatsoe’er
It is forbidden to repair.
