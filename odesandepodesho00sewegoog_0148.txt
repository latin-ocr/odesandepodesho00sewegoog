E'mv like the thunderheerer bird,
(Upon whom Jove, oi gode the king,

Supreme dominion heth oonierr’d

O‘er every wendeling vinged thing,
Having him faithful proved end true
In Ganymede of golden hue).

When youth end vigour of his sines
Heve on e day from eyrie high
Ieuneh'd him untoil'd ; and vemel aire
(The clouds now venish'd from eho sky)
Have taught him novel-ing et the firsh
Into unwonted simine ho burst 3

After e while with fervid glov,

The impewom spirit down heth sped
Upon the folds their evooping foe 5

Now upon diegons struggling dread
With felde reooil'd ihere pouneed his ssight
Love of the heuquet and the fight ;

Or as e lion-whelp, the which
Just of the guehing milk bereeved
0f brinded dem, on pasturas rich
Inteni e kidling heth pereeived 3

Poor kidling, doom’d fun soon, [forsooth]
To pexish by an unflesh'd toohh
