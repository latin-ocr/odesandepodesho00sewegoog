ODES OF HORACE.

Canidie, spere 1 end slaek, 0 elaek
Thy magio wheel swift whitled baele
He, Telephus, did move to greee

The eon of Nereus, in whose faee

The Myeiaus' sqmdrons he in pride
Hed merehell'd, end against whose side
Barb’d shafns had hm‘eling been. The demes
Of Ilion Hector wrapp'd in balme—
OEhe sleughterer Hector-when he lay
Senteneed to eavage birds a pley,

And dogs ; when once his eitadel
Abendon’d, the monarch fell

Before the feet, 111111 osone

In wreth unbending, Peleus' son.
Ulysses’ omnen sorely toil’d,

Their brietlemantled limbs despoil’d
Of their tough hides, when Oiree fain
So will'd it. Then did thought again,
And voiee ghde beck, end to eeeh 1111
Its wonted dignity end gmee.

Peid heve I full mffieiency‚

And more, of peneltiee to thee, ,
Ο thou the thiae-loveth end again,

By bergomen end hy market-men.
Fled 1111 my youth, and beehful eheen
Hae lest my bones, with sellow eltin
Hung loosely 0'er. My loeks ere hom·
With thy perfumee No peaeefiel hou1
Beek on my pillow doth me ley

From travail sore. Night tmads on day,
And day on night-nor there is might
My breash with geeping streined eight
Το lighten of ite burdam so
O’ervenquish’d am I in my woe,
