Hero, crowding with his company,
His pilos in concrete pour'd

The eontraot-builder siuks, and he
The lord who nauseam
The land. Yet soar and thmts

Soelo tho same places with the lord,

Nor quitteth care, as spectro black,

The bmss-beak'd ship of war,
And sits behind the trooper's back.

In pain, no Phrygia-n stone,
Nor habit, bn'ghter than the star,

Of purploe, mothos me, ποι· the vine

Of Persam why a. hall of mine,
On ponals for the eye
Of enyy, tow'ring high,
In fashion new, should I up-pile?

Riches that tenfold toi] entail?
