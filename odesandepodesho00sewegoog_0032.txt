ODES OF HORACE. [noox 1.

ODE VIIL
το mou.
fl Lydio, dio, per omooo.

Lm, npook, by all ohe gods
I charge theo, why such haste pursuing,

With fondling‚ Sybaris to min?
Why should he lootho the listed field
In the hot noon‚-in days bygono
Tho patient he of duob ond sun 2
Why neither midst his comrade friends,
A moilod knight, doth he bestrido
His charger, nor subdue ond guido
Its Gaulio mouth with wolf-fong'd curbo?
Why to touch ohe amber Tiber
Feors he? Why than blood of viper ⁸
Oil moro heodful doth ho shunh
Nor bruisod and blaokon'd now with mail ,
Bearshehisarms—ofmonyotale
He onoe tho hero, oft for quoit‚
Oh for javohn hurtled cleon
Beyond tho Emit? Why unsoen
Skulks he, os the son they say
Of Oooon Thetis, hid did lie,
As Troja’s toorfiss wreok drew nigh,
lost his gamb of man should sweep him
Hoodlong into the bloody froy
And Lyoia's squadron'd ohivohy?
