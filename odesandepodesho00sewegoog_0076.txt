ODES 01³ HORACE. [mox 11.

Abandon’d in no noble plight,

Thnt time when Valour’s sels in fight
Was aush’d, and thmt'ning fronts saluted,
E'en with tho chin the soil polluted.

But me, in panio crouching swist
Mercurius through the foe did list,

met in thick mist. Theo back onoe more
The re-engulfing billow bom,

W1th wething ffiths, into the war.
Therefore the feast, thy bounden mre,
Render to Jove, and lay to met

Τὴγ side, with Μίνω long distress'ss

My buy beneath ; nor spate the oasks
For thee design'd. Our burnish'd flnsks,
Brim with oblivious Maesio juioe :

From eopious shells pour balms profuse.
Who has the tosk to hasten home

Of parsley dew'd or myntle bloom

Our ohapletsfl Whom will Venus choose
Umpire and lord of our oemuse?

For me, I’ll revel not in mood

Smer than ssmcia‘s sisterhood

'Tin sweet to play the maniac's part,

My ffiend recover’d·t0 my heart.
