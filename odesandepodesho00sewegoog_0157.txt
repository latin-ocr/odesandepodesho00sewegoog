ent vnn] ODES OF HonAcn

To shrine. But on me doth not wait
This halent. Nor is thino the estate,

Or soul that noedeth gauds like these.
Thou dost delight in poesies 3

And poesies can we bestow,

And tell the present's value too,

Not manbles with a nation’s seal

Deep gmven (wherewithnl doth steni
Baok once again the life and breath

To glorious ehieftains nster death).

N ot rapid ronta, and threatenjngs [blank]
Of Hannibal retorted back 3

Not flaming fines of Omhnge, foe

To Heav'n, his laude more brightly show,
Who home return’d‚ having won ⁴ ’
Α name from Africa audone,

Than Oalnbn'e’s Pierian quir03

Nor, if what thou with noble fire

Hnst wrought‚ their records fail to show,
Wsst thou have gnin’d thy guerdon due.
What would the son of Ih'a be

And Marn if, rife with jealousy,

Silenoe the high deserte should bar

Of Romulus? So resnued far

Erom Stygian waves the soul highntrung
Of mighty hands, and love, and tongue,
Doth AEanus for holy rest

Consign to inlands of the blest.

The hero worthy praise the muse
Forbids to die. The muse endues

With gift of heaven. Thus above

At the thrioe-long'd-for feasts of Jove
Alcides, slothless hero, he

Assistetn The Tyndaridae,
