82 ODES OF HORACE. [ωσι 111.

Ilion’s fortune mmoending
'Nmth a funem] augury,
With a havoc md attending,
shall repeated be ; while I
Lead ho war the victor mew-
Ι, sponse of Jove and sister too.

‘fhough thrioe mise the wall of brass,
With Phoebus the emprize to cherish-

Thrioe by my Argives mass from mam
Dismantleh should it sall and perish :

Thrioe tho wife a captive led,

Wail o'er spouse and children [dead]¹

These thoughts with lyre for fmlic made
Gomporh not. spirit of my verse,
Where stmin’st thou? Bold presumptuous maid l
Oease the gods' converse to rehearse 3 y
And with thy shrains of lowly hone,
, - Themes os high vein to humble down.

ODE IV.
το ammom.
Descende coelo.

Dmemm thou from tho sphera,
And uther, haste, a longer stram
Forth from thy huto, Calliope my queen ;
Or hs, with thmljng voice, thou mayst prefer.
Or unto chorda, attuneth and harp to Phoebus dear. 1
