ODES OF HORACE.

Not singly et the curled heir

of en adulterer youth, end gold
About his ruiment deubed fuir,

And greoefirl trim of princely mould,
And trein, admiring caught the fleme,
Feir Helen, Iecedaemon's deme.

Nor wes it Teucer first who levell’d
His shnfcs hom bow in Cydon hewn 5

Not once alone was Ilion perill'd :

Not hugo Idomeneus alone
Or Sthenelus did wege their fights,
A worthy theme for muses' ffights

Not fieroeeoul’d Hector or the keen
Deiphobus was first to fece

So many e grievous blow to sorcen
Their modest wives end infant rece

There lived, ere Agamemnon's time,

But oll beyond the reooh of tear,
And, known to none, ere whehn'd end barr'd
'Neath a long night, because they ne’er
Possees'd e consecrated hard
Little doth differ hidden worth
From sloth interred in the earth.

I will not, Lollius, poss thee by,
Unnemed, undeck'd in peges mine 3
Or let oblivion’s livid eye
(lurp at so many toils of thine,
With none to ’venge thee. Thine's e ocul
Both in events of prescienee full,
