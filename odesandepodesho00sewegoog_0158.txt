13⁸ ODES 01¹ HORACE. [noon ιτ.

As constellation glioton'ng bright,

Rosouo our books in nhattor’d pfight
me oooon’s depthn His templos <light ,
With omen-old vine-lons, Baoehus brings
Our vows to blossed issuings.

' ν ODE IX.
ΤΟ uncus nomos.
Noforto orodoo.

Dm not porohonoe tho words will die,
Which of that far-resounding n'vor,
Tho AufiduS, o. notive I,

By magio ms before mo novor
Divulged‚ now nm uttering‚-words
meod to bo mmiod unto chordo.

N ot though Moeonion Homer owoo
The noblor post, are buriod yet
The stmins of Pindarus, and thoso
of Coos, or tho full of threat-
Thooo of Aloeus, ond tho muso
Majostio of Stesichorus.

Nor if Anacreon trified ought
In days of old, hoth lengthon’d ogo
Outblotted all. Tho passion’d thought
Is bmothing still, ond in hor page
Livo glowing firos intrusted woll
To the AEolian mondon's shell.
