Otium Diuus.
Eusu doth the wig'ht of heaven implum,

Soon as the murky cloud has whelm'd
The moon, nor stara of faith to guide‚
On mminers gleam oold
For ease doth Thracia madding wild
In war, for ease the Mediana pmy,
With quiver gruuud, aureasure not
With gems nor erimson bought to bo,
My Grosphus, norwith gold
For it is not the trenam-ed hoardu
Nor oonsul’s lictor that aloof

Bius stand the spirit’s tumultu sud,
And cares which round the fretted roof

Are over winging light.
well is life spent by him on little,
For whom, on table fiunish’d plain,
alitum the uult, his sire's heirloom‚
N or doth darm, or avarica mean
Snutch ofl‘ h'us ulumbers light.
