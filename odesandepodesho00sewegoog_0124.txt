AELmS, from ancient lamus lamed,
Since older Iamiae both, they tell,
Ἢ Wero titled henot), and of their sons
Thmugh many a storied chronicle
The moe entire its source derives
From that goeat panim, who the towers
OfFormioefimtofalLandLiris
Gliding into Marioa's shores,
Is stated to have temted,
A lordly ruler far around ;
Tamorrow will a tempest, swooping
From Eum, πῖον the woodland ground
With leaves, with worlhless weed the shore,
Unless that prophetess of min,
The raven, with ils load of years,
Deoeive me. While you may, ποτε in
Dry wood, To-morrow thou shall serve
Thy genius with the pure vine-juioe‚
And porlding os a two-mouth date, ,
Thou with thy household fmm their tasks let loose⁴
