Ibis Lfflwmie.

PAss wilt thou, friend, in shallops smil

dest yon armado’s sea-forts towen'ng,
At thy own ἀεὶ, Maeoenas, prompt

Το shaoe each ill on Ooesar lowefing.
And what of us, to whom our life

Is gladsom0, if mviving thou 3
Ifnot, a weaty load2 shall we,

At thy behest, pursue as now
Our peaoeful ease, but little ποοῦ

Unless with thee oonjoin'd we share itv
Or bravo this toil with seul, wherewith

It suits no silken men to beas it?
Bear it we wflL and either o'er

Alp-cliffs and Caucasus shelterless,
Or to the west’s remotesb gqu

With valorous beart will on thoe prees„
Ask you, how aid I toil of thino

By my exertion 2-1, not made
