ODES 01¹ HORACE.

το cmsvus sumnus
Nullam mento color εει.

Tam is in silver not a sheen, when hoarded

In the earth’s miser-bosom, thou deorier

Of the mere ore, my Sallust, if it shine not
With modest usage.

Live through a lengthen’d age with Promsseius,

Known for a father’s spin't to his brethren3

Hjm shall there wast, on wing afraid of flagging, ψ
Fame ever-dming.

Rule may you wider, by a gmsping spirit

Taming, than if you to remotest Gades

Libya joh, and either Punic host be
Serf to thee only.

Swells the cursed dropsy by itself indulging,

Nor repeks thirst, unless the ailment‘s cause has

Fled from the affricae, and the aqueous languor
From the pale body.

What though restored to Cyrus' throne, Phraates

Viduo, dissenting from the mob, erasos

From the blest's lists, and disenchants the world of 3
Using false titles ,·

Kingdom and soatheless diadem, and laurel

wholly his own, to one alono awamdjng,

Whosoe’er gazas on enormous heaps with
Eye undiverbed.
