152 ODES OF nomer.. [ουι ιι.

Rousod is ho by tho mmd’rous trumpet [loud‚]
Nor thrills with terror at the wrathfid aeas ;
Tho publio sorum, too, and porbals proud
Of subjoots mightier than himself he fines,
Thon either with the vine-plant& zucker, now,
Adult, the towering poplm he doth wod, ·
And lopping with his lmife each useless bough,
Ingmfla the more luxufiant in their ποιά ,·
Or, in some glen sequester'd, forth he gazas
On herde loose straying of his lowing beeves 3

Or honeys squeezed in taintlem anaks amasses,
Or his weak flocks he of their fleeoe relieves ;

Or,when his head dooored with mellow fruita
Autumn has listed from the mlltumd plain,
How joys he culling pem on gmsted shoots,
And gmpes competiug with the purple gmin,
Wherewith, Priapus, thee to gift, and thee,
Ο father Sylvan, of his bourns tho guard.
It likes him, now benoath some old holm-troo η
Το lie, and now on the retentiva md,
Whilom the waters glide deep banks between ;
Birds in the woodlands pour their phintive woioe ; ‹
Αἱιᾱ springs ‘gamat pebblos bmwl withweuing mms-
A mmmming, downy elumbem to eutice.
But soon aa Jove the Thunderer's wintry round
His magadnes of ra‘ms and snowdrists stores,
Either on bam'er'd toils with many a hound
From side to side ho driven the savage boars ;
Or with smooth streteh his filmy nets he sssrains,
Treaeheries the glutton thnmhes to surprise ;
And crouching hasa, and emigmtod omne
With springes capturos, a delicious prime.
Who feels not, mid these tasks med from his hart
Each noxious anxious thought, which love employs? ¹
