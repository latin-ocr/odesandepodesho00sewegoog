ODE XXVIII.

1¹0 mn

Festo quidpotifis ch'e.
Wm should I rather put in use
On Ν eptune's festal day? Produoe,
My Lyde, quick, thy Oaeoub homi,
And to gmve Wisdom, eircummmed,
A gentle violence apply.
Thou seelest that the noonday sky
Is sinldng: and, as if the day,
Δ so swistrwing'd, at thy voice would stay,
Thou grudgest fmm the ποτε to ssear
The amphora still h‘ng'ring there,
of Consul Bibulus„ In lays
Alternum we will Neptune mise,
And saa-green tresses of the. ohoir
Of Nereids: Thou with eurved lyre ·
Into shalt cham from answering ettings,
And the fleet Cynthian's mrow-stings 3
Hor in last carol, who is olajming
Cnidos, and those islets gleaming,
The Cyclades and Paphos fair
visits with her yoked pair

Of eygnets„ N ight shall named be, too,
In a gmve djtty richly dua
