8⁴ ODES OF HORACE. [11001111. 3

Wherever ye 1111111 stand
With me associate, cheerly glad
Ae meriner will I the raging med
Bosphorie ffith eesey, and the pereh'd send,
Ae wayserer, will breve of the Anynnn strand

ΓΠ visit Britons, towards
The sirenger ruthleee end the ewerm
Oeneenien gloating' oertheirmere’sblood [warm]; 1
visit the quiver-deek'd Geloninn horden, 1
And scythiae· river, Ι uneeethe'd [by their awende} ¹

Oaeeer sublime o’er foen, ·
When his troops, worn with bettle'e calis,
He harh diemiss'd 1ο ehelter in their weiie
Now ae he eeeke his weery toils to close,
Ye in Pierien gret invig'reie with repose.

Mild gentle eounsel you
Boih gire, end joy in it when given, Χ
Ye boon onee Well we wot how foes of Heaven, ¹
The 'litans end their savege monster erew,

He with his volley'd boli of ihunder overthrew-

He who the eeneeless land,
He who the tempest·tossing mein,
And eitiee, end the realms of grief and pain,
Ι And gods, and mortni thronge with single hand,

’Neeth hie just regal eway deth temper and commend Ἴ
Struek hed they into Jove,— 4
Thai truetful youth, -a dread alim,

As horrible they rose with many an erm,
And the [fell] ]broiherhood‚ who Pelion strove 1

To pile upon Olympus derk [with many e grove}
