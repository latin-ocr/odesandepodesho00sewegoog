om: xxm] ODES OF HORACE.

Temorrow let the Sire surprise
Either with one bleek pell the skies,
01· with a cloudlees sun Nought still
E'er will he canoel or repeel,
Whete’eris enee behlnd us: none
Will he reforge, or make undone

Of deede which enee the flying hour
Offeerfied Fortune, gloating 0'er
Her eruel lael, end stubborn bene
Te play her frolie insolent,

Her fiekle honours shifts al pleneme,

Now unte me profuse of treasure
Now to another. While she makes

Her stay, I preise her; if she shekes
Her repid pinione I reeign

Her bounties ; and in worth still mine
I wrap me, and with longing eye

Seek honest, dowerlese poverby.

’Tis net my int'resl, if the mast

Is groening 'neath the Siron blaet,

Το run end sink to prayere of woe,
And strive to bargain νοτ on vow,
Lesb prrien wares end Tyrien heap
More riehes on the g'reedy deep.

Then ’nealh the guardienship secure,
Of my light skiff with double oar,
Through storms AEgean some light eir
And the twin Pollux me shall beer.
