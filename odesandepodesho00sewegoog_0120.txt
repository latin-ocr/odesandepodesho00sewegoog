100 ODES OF nomeu. [11001 111.

Let her, the wife who in hor spousu alone
J oyoth, 001110 forth, when duty she hath done
Το the just gods 5 und her, the sistor too

of tho brlght chief 3 und fuir to view,

With suppliunt fillet, motheru of each lm
And youth late saved. Ο stuipllugu, [us ye paug]
And dumuels that by this your consorte know,
All wouls of omen ill forego.
This day in sooth u festival, ull eure
Of gloom shall lighten from me. I will seur
Nor tumult, nor to perish by the sword,
While Oaesur is of earth the lord.
Go, sor spiced oil, my boy, und orowns repair,
And unuh still mindful of the Mursiun war,
Is, as 110 soour‘d the phu'ns, by any hup,
Ono 1111111 could Spartacus escape.
Bid, too, Noaera speed-that minstrel maid,-
Her myrrh-buthed looks to fasten in a braid.
If any hind'ranoe through the portet rough
And loath'd 000111, (10 thou wulk off.
Ehuh whitening hair doth mitigate our passion,
Thimting 101 brawls and frowurd altercatiozh
I would not hear this, hot in youthful blood,
When Plancus as our consul stood.
