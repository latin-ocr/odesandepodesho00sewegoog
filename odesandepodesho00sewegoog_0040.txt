Pastor cem nabere.

Wm the shepherd o’er the sea, ’
In Ida’s barke was Helen dregging,

Her his hostess braitor he·-

In e joyless lull-time [fingging],
Nereus “whelm'd eaeh winged bresze‚
Το chent their ruthless destinies

Home art thou leading with ill omen
One, whom Greece will redemann

With full many a warrior foemen,
Oath-bound in e leegued band,

Thy bridal bonde te rive end wreek,

And Prinm's sov’reignty entique.

For steedsl how big for men! And thou

What deadly havoo Ι Even now
Palles sesque, and shield [for waning}
And ων, end firry is preparing.
