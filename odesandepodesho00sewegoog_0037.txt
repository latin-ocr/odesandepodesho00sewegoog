Alciden, too, 1'11 chent 3 end Lede’s boys,-

Femed ene with steede f'or venquishing his peers,
With oestusee the other3 soon es whose

Pele ster heth mirrer’d gleam'd on max-iners,

Down streame from rocks the agiteted epmy,

Winds dmp at enee, end clouds imm aether sweep 3
And (fer they so have will’d) th’ o'erpeering weve
Sinks in repone again upon the deep.

Of peaoefflness, οι· quuin¹e fames proud,

Regulue end the Seaun', and fihe men
Of his high spirit, when the Punic foe
Tn'umph’d‚ profuse, Paulus will I reheeme,
With muse of blezen, end Fabricius too.

Him and the Ouum with his looks unkempt,
And the Camillus, instmment of war,
Stem poverty created, end a firm
AneestreJ, with its meet and simple Lar.

There grows, like eree ef deep myseefiom age,
The glory of Mareellue Glitters bfight
The Julian planet in the midst of all,
Like Dien mide the lesser fires of night.

Reign thou, with Oaeear seeond but to thee.
