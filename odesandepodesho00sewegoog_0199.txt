THE SECULAR POEM 01³ HORACE. 179

For whom, unsoasshod, through bummg Troy,
AEneas pure, his oountry's fall
Surviving, pavod a passage fme,
Designing than their quitted all
More to replaoe.

Godsl toourloyalmanhoodsouls '

Of virtue‚—G0ds! to tranquil eld
Rem-to the Romuleam raoe

Both substance and an offspxing grant, ·

And offlrygmoe!

And he who with white steers adores you,-
He, of Anchises' glorious blood,
And Venus-mle he, lord above

The warring foe, to foe subdued
In mercy kind 1

O'er ooean now and land the Mede
His mighty hands and fasces dreads
Of Alba ; Turbam his awvoeds
Now seek, they once with haughty heads,
And sons of Ind,

Now Faith and Peme, and noble Tmth,
And pristine Shame, and she in soom
Long slightess Virum, dares retum,
And Plenty, bless'd with brimming horn,
Her face reveals·

And 'Augur Phoebus, he the graoed
With glittering bow, and weloome well
Το the nino Muses ; who the body's
Exhausted limbs with healthfifl spell
Relieves and heals.
