Pouring my pleint, soon as the nnhlunhing god,
with wine more fiery, from their plaee had stin’d
The secrete os a heah-h with passion glowing.
“ But if within my bosom there doth boil
My ire moheok'd, to eoatter ho the windo
These charmlees thougth mere fuel ho the fleme,
And eoothing not a whit the venom'd wound-

· My hanhhnlness (I send), now thrush away,
Will oease the lists ho enter moro with rivale
No fitting match? When with a brow auehere
These maxims Ι hed eulogized ho thy fano,
Order'd to hie me home, with faltering foot

I bruised. Now of one who vannts to vanquieh
In softness any girl, Lycisoe’s love
Posseeees me, from which there heve no power
To extricatam, not the adviee of· fn'ends
All unreserved, nor their reproaches grave 3
But e new passion for some mniden fair

Braidjng in knoh behind her flowing hair.
