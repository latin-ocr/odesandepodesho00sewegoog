ODES OF HORACE.

When Tullus was our consul,
To drink the smoky fume—

Teke, Maeoenee, e hundred glossas
Το your friend, now ense et home.

And the waking lemps prolong thou
To the morning light, end ser
Bo nll olnmour and wreth! Dismies thou

For the city, thy publio earo.

The Daoian Ootieon's bend
Hae fallen. The Medion foe,
Tum'd ’gainet himself, is betthng
With weepons snll of woe.

ΤΙιθ Cantaber, he merdant
Of old of the coasts of spem
Is now our serf, temed down
By hin toolato bolted ehm‘n.

E'en now tho Tmen horden,
With their bow unbent end elaok,

In their secret thoughts ore brooding
From their steppee to retine them bank.

Releesing now thy ome,
Lert the netion suffer ought 3⁴
Abaton thou, e private subjeohj
From indulging too heedful· thought
Seize glad the gists of the present honr,
And quit eh musing with strio‘oness fieught.
