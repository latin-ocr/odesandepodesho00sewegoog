Pcrciue strictae qualc'wni
More rarely now thy mecments closed
With knocks cn knocks the wauton youth cre shching·
Nor do they rob thee cf thy deep-and fcndly
Thy door tc iis threshcld clinga,
Thac which before 0’erfacile used tc move
Its hingcc Lcee and less thou now arc hearing,
‘While Ι, thy slave, tho livelong nights are dying,
0 Lydia, slecpcci thou 'i'
Bcldmne thyscli in huri cheli thou be wecping
Thy supercilioue paramcurs,
light and fantastic standing
Iu the lonc alley ε
While Thracia’s blasi its revels keeps

More fierce towards interlunar tides 3
What time in thee hot buming love and lust,

Thc deme of herces which ie wont tc madden‚
Sheil round ’chy fest'ring liver ragc,
Not without sorrowing wail,
Thac cur blithe youth dehghcs
In ivy green the more, end myrtle blech 3
Dry withcr'd leaves consigna
Το winter's comi-ede, Hebrus.
