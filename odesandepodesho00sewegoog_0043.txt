ODES OF HORACE.

Unto the clay his prima] base,
An stom oerved fmm every sid03
And the wild running h'on's funy
Unto the bowels osus applied5
’Twas wrath that laid ssyestes low
In dunt with whelming deadly blow 3

And unto citios tall hath proved
The primnl oannes why they nuk„
Wreck'd from their base, and o'er their walls
A host, with unwont triumph drnnk,
The foeman’s ploughshnse deep did stnke.
Uhnn'n down thy spin't 5-me nlike

In the delicious honr of youth,
The burning of the breast did try,
And into strains Inmbic, wing'd

Like amns, plunged me franticly.
Now seek Ι words of bitterness
-To change for such as soothe and bless3
If thou, a recantation made
Of all my obloquio& amnid
Become 011oe more of friendly pnrt,
And only give me back thino heart. ’
