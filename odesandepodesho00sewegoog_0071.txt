Equam memento rehu.

A som. true-balanced in distress,
Mind thou maintain 3 md noh the less
Midst blessings, one attemper'd mild
From joy presumptuous and wild3
Ο ΒθΠὶιιε, thou about to die,
Whether each hour in misery
Lived hssh thou, or on elbow sank
On some sequester’d grunay bank,
Hath bless’d thee throughout days divine
With inner sea] of Falern wine 5
Where ghmt fir and pophx white
A hospitable shade delight
To blend with boughs, and struggles ill
To huddle past with shnting nh
The ffitting crystal waher. Here
Wines and spioed unguente bid them bear,
And ποθή rosffblossoms of a date
Too shoihlived3 while as yet the state
Of things, and age, and sablo twine
Of the three sistere grant it thine.
Thou shalt retire fmm phrks amass’d
By pul-chazo ost, and mansion vast,
And villa, which that amber river
'fiber deth lave-rethe for ever ,·
And of thy wealhh, uppiled on high,
Thino heir shall have the mistel-y.
Be fich, from Inachus of yore
A child, it matters naught, or poor,
