ODE XI.

Movere.

O Mmconn 5 for school‘d by thee
His toacher, with hieminstreley ¹
Amphion motion breethed in stenes,
And thou, the deft, thy eohoing tonee 5
Beck from thy seven ohordsto pour, '
My ehell! nor blees'd with speech of yore,
Nor gintehil—yet a friendly guest Ι,
Both et the banquets of the bloet,

And holy senetuofiee now:

Pour etreins whereto may Lyde bow,

And rivet close her stubborn ears 5

She who, like fissy of three years,

In the broad pleins doth spoxt end frisk
With bound end etant, end dionis to riek
A touch 3-from wedlook 'ettetpedj end rew
still to her passion‘d husbend's lew.
