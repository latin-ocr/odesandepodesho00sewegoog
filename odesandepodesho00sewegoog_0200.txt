THE sucum ΡΟΕΜ ΟΡ HORACE.

If the Palatian tovers, and State
Of Rome, and Intium bloet he view
with ssv’n'ng oye, may he prolong
The age into a luem new,
And happier ayo 1

And she who Aventino doth away, ’
And Algidum, may she to prayers
Pour'd by the μὴ Fisteen take heed,
And to our stfipliugs' vows her ears
Benign close lay Ι

Hope good and sure I home report,

That J ove and the assembled gods
Ohedsh these thoughts3 tho chorus I
Both Phoebus and Diana’s lauds

Taught to display.
