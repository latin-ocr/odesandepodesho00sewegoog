ODES OF HORACE. [noos ι.

Out off, if shoeis which touch should ne'er profane, ἵ
Still godless berks ene bounding o'er. i
Bolden’d sil ills to brook, mankind doth burst
Through each forfended dsrk ebuso ; ζ
Bolden'd did J speh’s raes, with guilt eccurst,
Fire midst the natione iniroduee.
After that fine was from the dome purloin'd
Of heaven, on esrhh there swooping fell
Merasmus, end a hroop of monster kind
of severs 5 end the slowdoom’d spell
of death removed sier sill then,
Quick gether'd short ihs step on men.
Daedel, with pinions not io mortale lent,
Sounded the unsubstsniied sky 5
The travail of Alcides Acheron rent. .
Nought is for dying men too high.
Heaven's seli, in sensoless pride,
We seek to olimb ;

Nor suffer, by our crime,
Thoe Jove his levin-holte of wrahh should lny asido.

ΤΟ ΒΕΧΤῙΠΒ.
Senior doris hyems.

Mnnrms is winter hoen with grateful-ohsnge of spring, and
western wind, ,
And engines drag the ὼγ keels from the shore 3
And-neither now deth flook in sodis-nor hind in hemi
their pieasuro find 3
N or meads with hoary frosts stand silver'd o’er.
