ODES OF HORACE. [ιιοοι ιιι.

Now, weary with his drooping flock,
The herdsman seeks the shades, and brook,
And shnggy Sylvan’s bosky brakes ;
And ιιοι a voioeloes bank partakes

of wmd'ting breezes, Thou distress’ss
Μιιοοει what postuoe may tho best
Βοοοιιιο tho ιιιιιιο, and ill bestead

With οοιοε dost for the city dread,
what sores, and the land ruled 0’er
By Cyrus, Bactria, hath in storo

And Tanais disoord-rife. With sighb
Far-ming, in ο gloomy night,

Doth Heaven of each approaching mom
The issue whelm, and laughs ιο soom,
Is mortal man ιοο anxious fmt

O'er measure. What is present yet,
Remember thou with tranquil bremt
To mlo and εοιιΙοι all the mst
Onwasd is borno by some high power,
Like Tiber's stream, which at one hour
Down its oentral bed doth glide
021me into the Tyrrheno tide,

At another in one mass

Rocks oorroded ιο their base,

And trunks περι offi and cattle thmng‚
And homesteads tumbling rolls along,
Not without the clam’rous cry

0f mountain height and forest nigh‚
When the wild deluge wakes ιο atrise
Ήιο tranqm’l rivom He his life,

Lord of himself, will pass away,

And bless'd, who fmm day ιο day
Hath lioense, “I have lived‚” ιο say ς
