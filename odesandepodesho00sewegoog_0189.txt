That thie our love should mutual live ἔ
Othou‚ Neaera, doom'd to grieve
Fun eore'et my unyielding will ε
For ifin Flaccus there be still
ought of the man, he will not beer
With one more favour’d thou shouldst share
Night after night 3 and wroth at wrong
will seek his match. Nor will his strong
Resolve to beauty yield again,
When once it has been found to sin 3
If fix'd resentment to his hem
Hae pierced. But thou, whoe’er thou art,
Happier than me, end who elate
Now welk'st in triumph at my fate,
Thou shelt heve leave enrich'd to stand
With cattle, end with breedth of land,
And for thee may Pactolus flow,
Nor e'en escape thy power to know
meh secret end mysterlous pege
Of that resusciteted sege,
Pythagorae And surpees you may

„ Nireus in gmej yet, woe the day!
Her loves transferr’d elsewhere thou’lt mourn,
But I shall have my leugh in turn.
